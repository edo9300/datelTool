# datelTool

A tool for dumping/writing to internal flash of certain Datel DS carts.

Current carts supported:

* Action Replay (and possibly Action Replay Media Edition)
* Games N' Music
* Most Max Media Player carts used for Datel's slot2 products like Max Media Dock.

This program currently uses SD:/datelTools/datel_rom.bin as the binary path for dumping/writing flash contents. Do not run this app from the flashcart you will be reflashing!

This is designed to either run from DSi SD via Unlaunch/HiyaCFW or from a slot2 flashcart on DS/DS Lite!


Credit to edo9300 for figuring out the AUXSPI logic required to make this possible.
